          <li>Born in 1977 in an east bay suburb of San Francisco, California.</li><br>
          <li>Still in high school he began to wonder why Reggae music, coming from a relatively small group of poor black people, was such a powerful voice for equal rights and justice, and he longed to be a part of that worldwide struggle.</li><br>
          <li>After graduating from high school, Harrison studied jazz at Sonoma State University where he formed the fusion Reggae group Groundation in 1998.</li><br>
          <li>From 1999 to 2001 he created a college level course titled “the History of Reggae Music”, which he taught at Sonoma State University.</li><br>
          <li>From 2000-2012 Harrison produced a documentary film on the history of the Rastafarian movement and Reggae music; entitled “Holding on to Jah”.</li><br>
          <li>Today Harrison continues to be a driving force behind Groundation both in his role as lead vocalist and in his creative ability to develop exciting new music.</li><br>
